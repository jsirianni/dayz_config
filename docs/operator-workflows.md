# dzdeploy operator workflows

Run these commands from Windows or Linux using the existing ignored `deploy.yaml`.
Read-only operations work from any branch and do not change the host or use RCon.
Existing enrollment establishes SSH trust; changed host keys remain errors.

## Health and history

```text
dzdeploy health all
dzdeploy health nasdara --json
dzdeploy history all --since 24h
```

Health checks actual service/process identity, agent freshness, supervision, UDP
listeners, local A2S query identity, and fresh public DZSA discovery/mods. Installed
revision, last startup revision, and pending activation are reported separately.
Fleet output includes every configured target even when another target fails.
Nonzero exit means at least one required health check failed. Starting/updating
and unreachable servers are distinguished from a healthy running game.

History combines durable lifecycle events on newer agents with retained operation
results and explicit DayZ termination markers. It pairs clean exits with subsequent
readiness evidence within 45 minutes; a missing marker never proves a clean exit.
Historical log timestamps use file modification time and are identified as such.
The report explicitly marks incomplete history and bounded scans (2,000 events,
200 operations, and 24 RPT tails). Missing history does not mean no restarts occurred.

Existing agents remain inspectable through SFTP and a fixed read-only Windows
PowerShell collector over SSH. A restricted SFTP-only account cannot provide native
process inspection; the command reports that limitation instead of trusting saved
state. Newer agents write immutable UTC event files and advertise capabilities in
their fresh heartbeat. This does not automatically upgrade an existing host.
